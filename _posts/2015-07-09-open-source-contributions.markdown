description: Contribute to open source on a regular basis.

A great way to get involved into daily coding is an open source contribution. I always knew about it's importance but finally realize when I worked for SAP's open source project [ReviewNinja](https://www.github.com/reviewninja/review.ninja). Ever since I am back in Germany and working in a different team I don't have an Open Soruce project to contributeÂ§ anymore. I browsed Github a little and finally found something that was an eye catcher to me.

[Let's chat](https://github.com/sdelements/lets-chat/) is an open source [Slack](https://slack.com/) team chat solution alternative. In Palo Alto out team was heavily using Slack and we all loved it. It's not only a chat but has a lot of integrations with other tools. Foe example with hangouts: Simply write "/hangouts" in the chat field and open a hangout video chat. The link to the chat will automatically be posted in the chat so they can join by clicking it.

Let's chat has a working chat and registration system. Currently all the integrations are missing and not implemented yet. Furthermore it is an active project and is JavaScript based.
