I am Fabian and you're in my digital living room. But before I tell my story - want to [Grab a coffee](http://www.coffeenerd.de/)?

I'm a Software Develoeper at SAP in Walldorf, Germany. During the day I mostly contribute to a MongoDB integration for CloudFoundry using bosh. In my free time I love to [listen to good music](https://soundcloud.com/bakermatmusic/bakermat-black-cat-john-brown) or enjoy an adventure when traveling the world.
