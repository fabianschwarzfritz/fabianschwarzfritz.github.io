The project was created as part of a Software Engineering course at <a href="https://maps.google.de/maps?q=Duale+Hochschule+Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg+Karlsruhe,+Erzbergerstra%C3%9Fe,+Karlsruhe&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=49.0256,8.382826&amp;sspn=0.038552,0.104628&amp;oq=Duale+&amp;t=h&amp;hq=Duale+Hochschule+Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg+Karlsruhe,+Erzbergerstra%C3%9Fe,+Karlsruhe&amp;z=15">Duale Hochschule Karlsruhe</a>.</p></div><div class="event"><h1>Object Calisthenics Validator</h1><p>Object Calisthenics was introduced <a href="http://www.xpteam.com/">Jeff Bay</a> in  <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/twa/thoughtworks-anthology">The Thoughtworks Anthology</a> published by The Pragmatic Programmers.
The calisthenics consist of nine rules that are applied in a short coding challenge. The training focuses on Object Oriented principals. During the training the developer has to verify for himself if the his code adheres to the rules. 
As part of a <a href="https://github.com/fabianschwarzfritz/Object-Calisthenics-Analyzer-Documentation/blob/master/documents/report/_endversion/ValidatingTheObjectCalisthenics.pdf">student research paper</a>, I analysed the rules and implemented a tool to validate the rules. The eclipse plugin adds hints and warnings to each line where the rules are broken.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><p>Copyright: Fabian Schwarz-Fritz. <br /> Photocredit: Nicole Eigenmann.</p></div></div></body></html>
