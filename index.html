  <p>I've been developing services and applications for years, mostly for SAP. After working on the CloudFoundry
    offering that enabled teams to developing cloud-native applications, I dedicated my work onto deploying
    fully-managed Application Lifecycle Management on top of Kubernetes, I know spend my time as an application
    developer to build SAP's Data Warehouse Cloud.</p>
  <h2>Projects at Work</h2>
  <h3>Data Warehouse Cloud</h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/data-warehouse-cloud.html">SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</a> is a
    software-as-a-service Business Warehouse offering. It is an integrated, fully managed service, and persona-driven
    Data Warehouse as a Service solution, suitable for SAP and non-SAP customers offering reduced deployment complexity,
    flexible pricing with integration to SAP Intelligent Enterprise Suite solutions, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Cloud
    Platform services, Partner solutions and open-source technologies.</p>
  <h3>Gardener</h3>
  <p><a href="https://gardener.cloud">Gardener</a> is an open source project driven by SAP to create, update and monitor
    kubernetes clusters. Gardener can operate hundrets of clusters with operation, management and monitoring
    capabilities. I've initiated a project, now called <a href="https://github.com/gardener/potter-hub">Potter</a>,
    automating an fully managing installed software and services on top of those clusters. With that, stakeholders can't
    only get fully managed clusters, by the software on top of it are install- and opererateable in an "off-the-shelf"
    fashion.</p>
  <h3>Peripli</h3>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Peripli">Peripli</a>, or the Service Manager enables service consumption across
    different platforms. Platforms need to implement the <a href="https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/">Open Service
      Broker Api</a> and can then consume a service running in a remote platform. In a team I was developing this
    service brokner, enabling cross consumption between the different platform stacks, Neo, CloudFoundry and Kuberentes,
    at SAP.</p>
  <h3>ReviewNinja</h3>
  <p>"ReviewNinja is a light-weight code-review tool which fits neatly into the GitHub pull request workflow. It
    presents all the project information needed to commit a pull request and merge code confidently." [<a
      href="http://github.com/review.ninja/">ReviewNinja official</a>]. The tool was developed before GitHub Pull
    requests existed and provided line-by-line codereviews on top of the platform.</p>
  <h3>CatchyTune</h3>
  <p>CatchyTune is an online music player where artists can share their music and their fans listen to it. The project
    was created as part of a Software Engineering course at <a
      href="https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/startseite.html">Duale Hochschule Karlsruhe</a>. As it provided streaming of
    music and upload functionality, I am not hosting it anymore, for legal reasons. Also this was my first and only RoR
    project - the speed of initial development and prototyping was a blast, and is certainly the reason for the project
    being well-graded. Thanks <a href="https://dhh.dk/">David</a>!</p>
  <h3>XP days 2017</h3>
  <p>I went to the <a href="http://www.xpdays.de/2017/">XP days 2017</a> in Stuttgart. The content reached from
    practical teamwork by building a event hall with LEGO to<a
      href="http://www.xpdays.de/2017/sessions/170-scrum-erleben-wir-bauen-iterativ-ein-produkt-mit-lego-steinen.html">
      practice agile methodologies</a> over to theoretical lectures on <a
      href="http://www.xpdays.de/2017/sessions/132-agile-im-konzern-entwicklung-als-entwickler-anstossen.html"> how to
      push change as a developer in large organizations</a>.</p>
  <h3>Object Calisthenics Validator</h3>
  <p><a href="http://www.xpteam.com/">Jeff Bay's</a> "Object Calisthencs" are a short coding challenge described in <a
      href="https://pragprog.com/book/twa/thoughtworks-anthology">The ThoughtWorks Anthology</a>. I have created an
    Eclipse plugin to validate if code created during the training, satisfies the rules. The tool adds hints and
    warnings to the respective code line. As part of a <a
      href="https://github.com/fabianschwarzfritz/Object-Calisthenics-Analyzer-Documentation/blob/master/documents/report/_endversion/ValidatingTheObjectCalisthenics.pdf">student
      research paper</a> I have furthermore analyzed how such a validation for each rule could be implemented.</p>

  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>I am an avid diver in my freetime. Re-learned proper diving only after diving with <a
      href="https://www.gue.com">Global Underwater Explorers</a>, the diving association that formed out of the
    activities <a href="https://facebook.com/woodvillekarstplainproject/">Woodville Karst Plain Project</a>. They needed
    skilled and capable support diver for their projects and formed a diving association to train divers. Today, the
    standardized approach is what GUE is famous for and results in the best dive training one can find.</p>
  <p>While I am not yet diving in nasty cold cave, I do some activities in our local lake. We have established a <a
      href="https://www.projectbaselinerheinauersee.de">Project Baseline</a> at our local lake and monitor underwater
    changes regurly. Hopefully this will allow us to draw conclusions in a few years from now about how climate change
    affects out local waters. Ah, and if you whant to go diving in the Rhein-Neckar-Area, just contact me on facebook, I
    am always up to diving with new people.</p>
  <p>As part of the project, we have also created a video how to <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA68XNoVAec">measure visibility</a> at the underwater station. There you can
    see me in action.</p>
