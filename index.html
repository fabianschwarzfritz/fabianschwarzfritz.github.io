    <h1>Welcome &#128075;</h1>
    <p>
      üë®‚Äçüíª I started writing my first lines of code when I was a teenager and never stopped.
      Fast forward fifteen years and I excelled in being a leader
      and individual contributor for both Kuberentes based cloud platforms and user-facing application software.
    </p>
    <p>
      üß≥ Due to recent mass-layoffs at Shopify I'm currently looking for
      open positions and new challenges. I was a Staff Software Engineer there and before I worked at SAP for years.
      I'm looking leadership positions as individual contributor (Staff/Principal Engineer) or team-lead positions (Engineering Manager).

    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>
     ü§ø I love scuba diving and love to spend my freetime underwater! After taking a fundamentals scuba class with
     <a href="https://www.gue.com">Global Underwater Explorers</a>, it's even more fun and I love 
     scuba diving and scootering in the local lakes in the Rhein-Neckar-Area.
    </p>
    <p>
     I took over the <a href="https://www.projectbaselinerheinauersee.de">Project Baseline</a> and monitor underwater changes regurly.
     Hopefully this will allow us to draw conclusions in a few years from now about how climate change affects out local waters.
     Together with my dive buddies and friends we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA68XNoVAec">measure visibility</a> at the station regularly.

  <h2>Projects at Work</h2>

  <h3>Data Warehouse Cloud</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/data-warehouse-cloud.html">SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</a> is a
    software-as-a-service Business Warehouse offering.
    I technically lead a team and we brought concept to production of the data warehouse task management system in 6 months.
    The system is used by 200+ customers for production data warehousing and manages 86.000 data long-running data replication tasks per day. Over the three years the software has grown and now supports features like cloud-native resiliency and task chains.
    I helped bringing technical concepts and enginneering approaches from the cloud-native to SAP's business warehouse world.
  </p>
  <h3>Gardener</h3>
  <p><a href="https://gardener.cloud">Gardener</a> is an open source project driven by SAP to create, update and monitor
    kubernetes clusters.
    Gardener can operate hundrets of clusters with operation, management and monitoring capabilities.
    I've initiated a project, now called <a href="https://github.com/gardener/potter-hub">Potter</a>, automating an fully managing installed software and services on top of those clusters.
    Stakeholders can define their software bill-of-materials and the hub deploys and reconciles packages on the cluster.
    Besides technical CRDs, a user friendly UI helps exploring available packages and monitoring what's running on the cluster.
  </p>
  <h3>Peripli</h3>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Peripli">Peripli</a>, or the Service Manager enables service consumption across
    different platforms. Platforms need to implement the <a href="https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/">Open Service
      Broker Api</a> and can then consume a service running in a remote platform. In a team I was developing this
    service brokner, enabling cross consumption between the different platform stacks, Neo, CloudFoundry and Kuberentes.</p>
  <h3>ReviewNinja</h3>
  <p>
    "ReviewNinja is a light-weight code-review tool which fits neatly into the GitHub pull request workflow.
    It presents all the project information needed to commit a pull request and merge code confidently." [<a
      href="http://github.com/review.ninja/">ReviewNinja official</a>]. The tool was developed before GitHub Pull
    requests existed and provided line-by-line codereviews on top of the platform.</p>
  <h3>CatchyTune</h3>
  <p>
    A fun student project I did part of my studies at <a href="https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/startseite.html">Duale Hochschule Karlsruhe</a>. It's an online music player with upload and search functionality writte in ruby on rails.
  <h3>XP days 2017</h3>
  <p>I went to the <a href="http://www.xpdays.de/2017/">XP days 2017</a> in Stuttgart. The content reached from
    practical teamwork by building a event hall with LEGO to<a
      href="http://www.xpdays.de/2017/sessions/170-scrum-erleben-wir-bauen-iterativ-ein-produkt-mit-lego-steinen.html">
      practice agile methodologies</a> over to theoretical lectures on <a
      href="http://www.xpdays.de/2017/sessions/132-agile-im-konzern-entwicklung-als-entwickler-anstossen.html"> how to
      push change as a developer in large organizations</a>.</p>
  <h3>Object Calisthenics Validator</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.xpteam.com/">Jeff Bay's</a> "Object Calisthencs" are a short coding challenge described in <a
      href="https://pragprog.com/book/twa/thoughtworks-anthology">The ThoughtWorks Anthology</a>. I created an
    Eclipse plugin to validate if code created during the training, satisfies the rules. The tool adds hints and
    warnings to the respective code line. As part of a <a
      href="https://github.com/fabianschwarzfritz/Object-Calisthenics-Analyzer-Documentation/blob/master/documents/report/_endversion/ValidatingTheObjectCalisthenics.pdf">student
      research paper</a> I have furthermore analyzed how such a validation for each rule could be implemented.</p>
