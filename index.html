Platforms need to implement the <a href="https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/">Open Service Broker Api</a> and can then consume a service running in a remote platform. From a developer's perspective the service feels like it was integrated directly into the local platform.</p>

I have created an Eclipse plugin to validate if code created during the training, satisfies the rules. The tool adds hints and warnings to the respective code line. As part of a <a href="https://github.com/fabianschwarzfritz/Object-Calisthenics-Analyzer-Documentation/blob/master/documents/report/_endversion/ValidatingTheObjectCalisthenics.pdf">student research paper</a> I have furthermore analyzed how such a validation for each rule could be implemented.</p>
